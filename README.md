# Numerical simulation of the evolution of the pacreatic cancer and the axons regulation.

## Python module required to run the python script.
---
Numpy (probably already installed):
```sh
$ pip install --user numpy
```
---
numba:
```sh
$ pip install --user numba
```
---
Matplotlib:
```sh
$ pip install --user matplotlib
```
## Main features

The main features of the library are:
- the numerical computation of the coupled dynamical system modeling the evolution of the pancreatic cancer and axons' remodeling,
- the numerical computation of in silico denervation on the system,
- the visualization of the evolution of the solution.



## Run on local machine 
```sh
$ python Example_HFF.py
```
